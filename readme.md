## CI/CD Integration with Azure

I am planning to implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy this application on Azure App Service. This will allow for automated testing and deployment whenever changes are made to the codebase. 

### GitHub Workflow

The workflow will be configured to build and deploy a Docker container of the application to Azure App Service. For more information on setting up GitHub Actions for Azure, refer to [Azure App Service Deployment Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions).
